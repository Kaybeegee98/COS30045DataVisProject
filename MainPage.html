                    Migration is defined as the movement from one
                    country, place or locality to another. 
                    Migration can occur in a number of
                    factors like unemployment, inflation 
                    and cost of living just to name a few. Increasingly more and more people are being displaced from their homes due to world events. In this project 
                    we want to understand why migration occurs, these set of visualisations will be used primary as a way to gauge the number of people migrating to Australia from other countries. It will also show migration 
                    between Australia's states and territories. 

                    The ultimate goal for this Visualisation is to provide information to the user about people migrating to Australia from other countries and migration from state to state.
                    The website will allow users to:
                    </span><ul>
                        <li><span class="highlight">Understand why migration occurs</span></li>
                        <li><span class="highlight2">Where people are migrating from to come to Australia</span></li>
                        <li>Where people are migrating to from Australia</li>
                        <li>Why people are migrating and what are the factors</li>
                        <li>Understand the trend of migration </li>
                    </ul>
                    Our website will also include a comparative graph with all the data that shows the 
                    data for the unemployment rates and the inflation rates of countries that people move from to come to Australia the most
                    These are the figures for the net overseas migration to Australia from 2005 to 2022.
