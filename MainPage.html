                    Migration is defined as the movement from one
                    country, place or locality to another. 
                    Migration can occur in a number of
                    factors like unemployment, inflation 
                    and cost of living just to name a few. Increasingly more and more people are being displaced from their homes due to world events. In this project 
                    we want to understand why migration occurs, these set of visualisations will be used primary as a way to gauge the number of people migrating to Australia from other countries. It will also show migration 
                    between Australia's states and territories. 

                    The ultimate goal for this Visualisation is to provide information to the user about people migrating to Australia from other countries and migration from state to state.
                    The website will allow users to:
                    </span><ul>
                        <li><span class="highlight">Understand why migration occurs</span></li>

                        <li>Understand the trend of migration </li>
                    </ul>
                    Our website will also include a comparative graph with all the data that shows the 
                    data for the unemployment rates and the inflation rates of countries that people move from to come to Australia the most
                    These are the figures for the net overseas migration to Australia from 2005 to 2022.

            <h2 class="subheadingTitle">What is Inflation Rate and Why is it Important?</h2>
            <p class="textBox"> <span class="highlight">
                A brief description of the inflation rate is that it is simply the rate of increase in prices over a given period. Typically if a country has a higher inflation rate, it means the cost of living increases quicker than those countries with a lower inflation rate. When looking at different countries migrating to Australia, a question we wanted to answer was, “Why do people migrate to Australia?”. A generally lower cost of living was one of our proposed answers to this question, especially when combined with a lower unemployment rate (more on that later).
                The below graph is set up to allow users to view the difference in inflation rates between countries moving to Australia and Australia itself. From this, we hope we can see patterns in the inflation rates that might describe why people are migrating to Australia.
                The rationale we are thinking about during this is if a country has a disproportionately large inflation rate when compared to Australia, then the migration rate to Australia should be larger.
